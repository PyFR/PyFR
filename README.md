# PyFR

## Overview

PyFR is an open-source Python based framework for solving advection-diffusion
type problems on streaming architectures using the Flux Reconstruction
approach of Huynh. The framework is designed to solve a range of governing
systems on mixed unstructured grids containing various element types. It is
also designed to target a range of hardware platforms via use of an in-built
domain specific language derived from the Mako templating engine.

## Examples

Test cases are available in the
[PyFR-Test-Cases](https://github.com/PyFR/PyFR-Test-Cases) repository.
