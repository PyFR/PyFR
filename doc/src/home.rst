What is PyFR?
-------------
PyFR is an open-source Python based framework for solving
advection-diffusion type problems on streaming architectures using the
Flux Reconstruction approach of Huynh. The framework is designed to
solve a range of governing systems on mixed unstructured grids
containing various element types. It is also designed to target a range
of hardware platforms via use of an in-built domain specific language
derived from the Mako templating engine. The current release (PyFR
|release|) has the following capabilities:

- Governing Equations - Euler, Navier Stokes
- Dimensionality - 2D, 3D
- Element Types - Triangles, Quadrilaterals, Hexahedra, Prisms,
  Tetrahedra, Pyramids
- Platforms - CPU Clusters, Nvidia GPU Clusters, AMD GPU Clusters
- Spatial Discretisation - High-Order Flux Reconstruction
- Temporal Discretisation - Explicit Runge-Kutta
- Precision - Single, Double
- Mesh Files Imported - Gmsh (.msh)
- Solution Files Exported - Unstructured VTK (.vtu, .pvtu)
