[soln-plugin-ascent]
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Uses `Alpine Ascent <https://github.com/Alpine-DAV/ascent>`_ to plot on-the-fly
. The following parameters can then be set:

1. ``nsteps`` --- produce the plots every ``nsteps`` time steps:

    *int*

2. ``division`` --- the level of linear subdivison to use

    *int*

3. ``region`` --- region to visualise, specified as either the
   entire domain using ``*`` or a combination of the geometric shapes
   specified in :ref:`regions`:

    ``*`` | ``shape(args, ...)``

There are then three components that can be used to build plots. Scenes which
define the render, Pipelines that can be used to apply filers and build
sequenceces of data manipulations, and Fields which are used to define field
expresions.

1. ``field-{name}`` --- this is an extension to the Ascent library where users
define expressions for the fields used. This can either be a scalar or a
vector, where the latter is defined by a comma separted list of expressions.

    *string* | *string*, *string* (, *string*)

2. ``scene-{name}`` --- a scene to plot with Ascent options passed in a
dictionary. Each scene needs a field, and the expression for that field must
have been set either via a field command or a pipeline. Additionally, one or
multiple ``render-{name}`` dictionaries must be defined to configure the
rendering of the scene. Multiple render dictionaries give multiple views of
the same scene.

    *dict*

3. ``pipeline-{name}`` --- a pipeline of data manipulations that can be used
within a scene. The value is a dictionary containing the valid configuration
options. Pipeline objects can be stacked together to form a pipeline of filters
by making a list of dictionaries. Finally, the q-criterion and vorticity
filters require that a field called velocity is defined.

   *dict* | [*dict*]

Example::

    [soln-plugin-ascent]
    nsteps = 200
    division = 5

    field-kenergy = 0.5*rho*(u*u + v*v)
    scene-ke = {'render-1': {'image-name': 'ke-{t:.1f}'}, 'field': 'kenergy', 'type': 'pseudocolor'}

    field-mom = rho*u, rho*v
    pipeline-amom = {'type': 'vector_magnitude', 'field': 'mom', 'output-name': 'mag'}
    scene-va = {'type': 'pseudocolor', 'pipeline': 'amom', 'field': 'mag', 'render-1': {'image-width': 128, 'image-name': 'm1-{t:4.2f}'}, 'render-2': {'image-width': 256, 'image-name': 'm2-{t:4.2f}'}}

Note that setting ``nsteps`` to be too small can have a significant impact on
performance as generating each image has overhead and may require some
MPI communication to occur.

This plugin also exposes functionality via a CLI. The following functions
are available

1. ``pyfr ascent render`` --- render an image from a pre-existing mesh and
solution file. It must be run with the same number of ranks as partitions in
the mesh. By default it will use settings from the first section of the settings
file that it is passed. Alternatively, a specific section name can be
provided. In both cases all other sections are ignored.

   Example::

    pyfr ascent render mesh.pyfrm solution.pyfrs settings.ini
