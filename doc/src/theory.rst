Flux Reconstruction
===================

Overview
--------

High-order numerical methods for unstructured grids combine the
superior accuracy of high-order spectral or finite difference methods
with the geometrical flexibility of low-order finite volume or finite
element schemes. The Flux Reconstruction (FR) approach unifies various
high-order schemes for unstructured grids within a single framework.
Additionally, the FR approach exhibits a significant degree of element
locality, and is thus able to run efficiently on modern streaming
architectures, such as Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). The
aforementioned properties of FR mean it offers a promising route to
performing affordable, and hence industrially relevant, scale-resolving
simulations of hitherto intractable unsteady flows (involving
separation, acoustics etc.) within the vicinity of real-world
engineering geometries. An detailed overview of the FR approach is
given in:

Linear Stability
----------------

The linear stability of an FR schemes depends on the form of the
correction function. Linear stability issues are discussed in:

Non-Linear Stability
--------------------

The non-linear stability of an FR schemes depends on the location of the
solution points. Non-linear stability issues are discussed in:
