Installation
------------

Overview
^^^^^^^^

PyFR |release| can be installed using `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_
and `virtualenv <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_, as shown in the
quick-start guides below.

Alternatively, PyFR |release| can be installed from
`source <http://www.pyfr.org/download.php>`_. To install the software from
source, use the provided ``setup.py`` installer or add the root PyFR directory
to ``PYTHONPATH`` using::

    user@computer ~/PyFR$ export PYTHONPATH=.:$PYTHONPATH

When installing from source, we strongly recommend using
`pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_ and
`virtualenv <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`_ to manage the Python
dependencies.

Quick-start macOS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We recommend using the package manager `homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_.
Open the terminal and install the dependencies with the following commands::

    brew install python3 open-mpi metis
    pip3 install virtualenv

For visualisation of results, either install Paraview from the command line::

    brew cask install paraview

or dowload the app from the Paraview `website <https://www.paraview.org/>`_.
Then create a virtual environment and activate it::

    virtualenv --python=python3 ENV3
    source ENV3/bin/activate

Finally install PyFR with `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_ in the
virtual environment::

    pip install pyfr

This concludes the installation. In order to run PyFR with the OpenMP backend
(see `Running PyFR`_), use the following settings in the configuration file
(``.ini``)::

    [backend-openmp]
    cc = gcc-8
    cblas = /usr/lib/libblas.dylib
    cblas-type = parallel

Note the version of the compiler which must support the ``openmp`` flag.
This has been tested on macOS 10.14.

Quick-start Ubuntu
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open the terminal and install the dependencies with the following commands::

    sudo apt install python3 python3-pip libopenmpi-dev openmpi-bin
    sudo apt install metis libmetis-dev libblas3
    pip3 install virtualenv

For visualisation of results, either install Paraview from the command line::

    sudo apt install paraview

or dowload the app from the Paraview `website <https://www.paraview.org/>`_.
Then create a virtual environment and activate it::

    python3 -m virtualenv ENV3
    source ENV3/bin/activate

Finally install PyFR with `pip <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_ in the
virtual environment::

    pip install pyfr

This concludes the installation. In order to run PyFR with the OpenMP backend
(see `Running PyFR`_), use the following settings in the configuration file
(``.ini``)::

    [backend-openmp]
    cc = gcc
    cblas = /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/blas/libblas.so.3
    cblas-type = parallel

This has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04.

Running PyFR
============

Overview
--------

PyFR |release| uses three distinct file formats:

1. ``.ini`` --- configuration file
2. ``.pyfrm`` --- mesh file
3. ``.pyfrs`` --- solution file

The following commands are available from the ``pyfr`` program:

1. ``pyfr import`` --- convert a `Gmsh
   <http:http://geuz.org/gmsh/>`_ .msh file into a PyFR .pyfrm file.

   Example::

        pyfr import mesh.msh mesh.pyfrm

2. ``pyfr partition`` --- partition an existing mesh and
   associated solution files.

   Example::

       pyfr partition 2 mesh.pyfrm solution.pyfrs .

3. ``pyfr run`` --- start a new PyFR simulation. Example::

        pyfr run mesh.pyfrm configuration.ini

4. ``pyfr restart`` --- restart a PyFR simulation from an existing
   solution file. Example::

        pyfr restart mesh.pyfrm solution.pyfrs

5. ``pyfr export`` --- convert a PyFR .pyfrs file into an
   unstructured VTK .vtu or .pvtu file. Example::

        pyfr export mesh.pyfrm solution.pyfrs solution.vtu

Running in Parallel
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``pyfr`` can be run in parallel. To do so prefix ``pyfr`` with
``mpiexec -n <cores/devices>``. Note that the mesh must be
pre-partitioned, and the number of cores or devices must be equal to
the number of partitions.
