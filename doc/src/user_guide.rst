Running PyFR
============

PyFR |release| uses three distinct file formats:

1. ``.ini`` --- configuration file
2. ``.pyfrm`` --- mesh file
3. ``.pyfrs`` --- solution file

The following commands are available from the ``pyfr`` program:

1. ``pyfr import`` --- convert a `Gmsh
   <http:http://geuz.org/gmsh/>`_ .msh file into a PyFR .pyfrm file.

   Example::

        pyfr import mesh.msh mesh.pyfrm

2. ``pyfr partition`` --- partition or repartition an existing mesh and
   associated solution files.

   Example::

       pyfr partition 2 mesh.pyfrm solution.pyfrs outdir/

   Here, the newly partitioned mesh and solution are placed into the
   directory `outdir`.  Multiple solutions can be provided.
   Time-average files can also be partitioned, too.

   For mixed grids one must include the ``-e`` flag followed by weights
   for each element type, or the ``balanced`` argument. Further details
   can be found in the :ref:`performance guide <perf mixed grids>`.

3. ``pyfr run`` --- start a new PyFR simulation. Example::

        pyfr run mesh.pyfrm configuration.ini

4. ``pyfr restart`` --- restart a PyFR simulation from an existing
   solution file. Example::

        pyfr restart mesh.pyfrm solution.pyfrs

   It is also possible to restart with a different configuration file.
   Example::

        pyfr restart mesh.pyfrm solution.pyfrs configuration.ini

5. ``pyfr export`` --- convert a PyFR ``.pyfrs`` file into an
   unstructured VTK ``.vtu`` or ``.pvtu`` file. If a ``-k`` flag is
   provided with an integer argument then ``.pyfrs`` elements are
   converted to high-order VTK cells which are exported, where the
   order of the VTK cells is equal to the value of the integer
   argument. Example::

        pyfr export -k 4 mesh.pyfrm solution.pyfrs solution.vtu

   If a ``-d`` flag is provided with an integer argument then
   ``.pyfrs`` elements are subdivided into linear VTK cells which are
   exported, where the number of sub-divisions is equal to the value of
   the integer argument. Example::

        pyfr export -d 4 mesh.pyfrm solution.pyfrs solution.vtu

   If no flags are provided then ``.pyfrs`` elements are converted to
   high-order VTK cells which are exported, where the order of the
   cells is equal to the order of the solution data in the ``.pyfrs``
   file.

   By default all of the fields in the ``.pyfrs`` file will be
   exported. If only a specific field is desired this can be specified
   with the ``-f`` flag; for example ``-f density -f velocity`` will
   only export the *density* and *velocity* fields.

PyFR can be run in parallel. To do so prefix ``pyfr`` with
``mpiexec -n <cores/devices>``. Note that the mesh must be
pre-partitioned, and the number of cores or devices must be equal to
the number of partitions.

.. _configuration-file:

Configuration File (.ini)
=========================

The .ini configuration file parameterises the simulation. It is written
in the `INI <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file>`_ format.
Parameters are grouped into sections. The roles of each section and
their associated parameters are described below. Note that both ``;`` and
``#`` may be used as comment characters.  Additionally, all parameter
values support environment variable expansion.

Backends
--------

These sections detail how the solver will be configured for a range of
different hardware platforms. If a hardware specific backend section is omitted,
then PyFR will fall back to built-in default settings.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 3

   backends/backend.rst
   backends/backend-cuda.rst
   backends/backend-hip.rst
   backends/backend-metal.rst
   backends/backend-opencl.rst
   backends/backend-openmp.rst

Systems
-------

These sections setup and control the physical system being solved, as well as
charateristics of the spatial and temporal schemes to be used.

   systems/solver.rst

   systems/solver-entropy-filter.rst
   systems/solver-artificial-viscosity.rst
   systems/solver-interfaces.rst
   systems/soln-filter.rst

Boundary and Initial Conditions
-------------------------------

These sections allow users to set the boundary and initial
conditions of calculations.

   :maxdepth: 3

   boundary-initial-conditions/soln-bcs.rst
   boundary-initial-conditions/soln-ics.rst

Nodal Point Sets
----------------

Solution point sets must be specified for each element type that is used and
flux point sets must be specified for each interface type that is used. If
anti-aliasing is enabled then quadrature point sets for each element and
interface type that is used must also be specified. For example, a 3D mesh
comprised only of prisms requires a solution point set for prism elements and
flux point sets for quadrilateral and triangular interfaces.

Plugins
-------

Plugins allow for powerful additional functionality to be swapped
in and out. There are two classes of plugin available; solution
plugins which are prefixed by ``soln-`` and solver plugins which
are prefixed by ``solver-``. It is possible to create multiple
instances of the same solution plugin by appending a suffix, for
example::

    [soln-plugin-writer]
    ...

    [soln-plugin-writer-2]
    ...

    [soln-plugin-writer-three]
    ...

Certain plugins also expose functionality via a CLI, which can
be invoked independently of a PyFR run.

Regions
^^^^^^^

Certain plugins are capable of performing operations on a subset of the
elements inside the domain. One means of constructing these element
subsets is through parameterised regions. Note that an element is
considered part of a region if *any* of its nodes are found to be
contained within the region. Supported regions:

Rectangular cuboid ``box(x0, x1)``
  A rectangular cuboid defined by two diametrically opposed vertices.
  Valid in both 2D and 3D.

Conical frustum ``conical_frustum(x0, x1, r0, r1)``
  A conical frustum whose end caps are at *x0* and *x1* with radii
  *r0* and *r1*, respectively. Only valid in 3D.

Cone ``cone(x0, x1, r)``
  A cone of radius *r* whose centre-line is defined by *x0* and *x1*.
  Equivalent to ``conical_frustum(x0, x1, r, 0)``. Only valid in 3D.

Cylinder ``cylinder(x0, x1, r)``
  A circular cylinder of radius *r* whose centre-line is defined by
  *x0* and *x1*. Equivalent to ``conical_frustum(x0, x1, r, r)``.
  Only valid in 3D.

Cartesian ellipsoid ``ellipsoid(x0, a, b, c)``
  An ellipsoid centred at *x0* with Cartesian coordinate axes whose
  extents in the *x*, *y*, and *z* directions are given by *a*, *b*,
  and *c*, respectively. Only valid in 3D.

Sphere ``sphere(x0, r)``
  A sphere centred at *x0* with a radius of *r*. Equivalent to
  ``ellipsoid(x0, r, r, r)``. Only valid in 3D.

All region shapes also support rotation.  In 2D this is accomplished by
passing a trailing `rot=angle` argument where `angle` is a rotation
angle in degrees; for example ``box((-5, 2), (2, 0), rot=30)``.
In 3D the syntax is `rot=(phi, theta, psi)` and corresponds to a
sequence of Euler angles in the so-called *ZYX convention*.  Region
expressions can also be added and subtracted together  arbitrarily.
For example
``box((-10, -10, -10), (10, 10, 10)) - sphere((0, 0, 0), 3)`` will
result in a cube-shaped region with a sphere cut out of the middle.

Additional Information
----------------------

The :ref:`INI<configuration-file>` file format is very versatile. A feature that
can be useful in defining initial conditions is the substitution feature and
this is demonstrated in the :ref:`soln-plugin-integrate` plugin example.

To prevent situations where you have solutions files for unknown
configurations, the contents of the ``.ini`` file are added as an attribute
to ``.pyfrs`` files. These files use the HDF5 format and can be
straightforwardly probed with tools such as h5dump.

In several places within the ``.ini`` file expressions may be used. As well as
the constant ``pi``, expressions containing the following functions are
supported:

1. ``+, -, *, /`` --- basic arithmetic

2. ``sin, cos, tan`` --- basic trigonometric functions (radians)

3. ``asin, acos, atan, atan2`` --- inverse trigonometric functions

4. ``exp, log`` --- exponential and the natural logarithm

5. ``tanh`` --- hyperbolic tangent

6. ``pow`` --- power, note ``**`` is not supported

7. ``sqrt`` --- square root

8. ``abs`` --- absolute value

9. ``min, max`` --- two variable minimum and maximum functions,
   arguments can be arrays
