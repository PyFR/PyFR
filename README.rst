PyFR
====

Overview
--------

PyFR is an open-source Python based framework for solving
advection-diffusion type problems on streaming architectures using the
Flux Reconstruction approach of Huynh. The framework is designed to
solve a range of governing systems on mixed unstructured grids
containing various element types. It is also designed to target a range
of hardware platforms via use of an in-built domain specific language
derived from the Mako templating engine.

PyFR is being developed in the `Vincent Lab <https://www.imperial.ac.uk/aeronautics/research/vincentlab/>`_,
Department of Aeronautics, Imperial College London, UK.
