====

Overview
--------

PyFR is an open-source Python based framework for solving
advection-diffusion type problems on streaming architectures using the
Flux Reconstruction approach of Huynh. The framework is designed to
solve a range of governing systems on mixed unstructured grids
containing various element types. It is also designed to target a range
of hardware platforms via use of an in-built domain specific language
derived from the Mako templating engine.
