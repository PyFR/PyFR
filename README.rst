PyFR
====

Overview
--------

PyFR is an open-source Python based framework for solving
advection-diffusion type problems on streaming architectures using the
Flux Reconstruction approach. The framework is designed to solve a
range of governing systems on mixed unstructured grids containing
various element types. It is also designed to target a range of
streaming architectures via use of an in-built domain specific language
derived from the Mako templating engine.

PyFR is being developed in the `Vincent Lab<https://www.imperial.ac.uk/aeronautics/research/vincentlab/>`_,
Department of Aeronautics, Imperial College London, UK.
